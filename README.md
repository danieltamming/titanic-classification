An exploration of the classic Titanic Survival Kaggle dataset. 

My second ever Kaggle notebook, exploring the Titanic Survival dataset. My first submission achieved results in the 21st percentile. The Kaggle kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dtamming/titanic-classification). Wanting to familiarize myself with scikit-learn's model_selection submodule, I placed a special emphasis on hyperparameter tuning.
